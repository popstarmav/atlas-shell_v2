# Atlas Shell v2

Atlas Shell v2 is a simple command-line shell implemented in C for educational purposes. It is designed to mimic the behavior of standard Unix/Linux shells, offering features like command execution, input/output redirection, and error handling. This shell was created as a systems programming project.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Supports running basic shell commands such as `ls`, `cat`, `pwd`, etc.
- **Built-in Commands**: Includes built-in commands like `cd`, `exit`, and others.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors for command execution, syntax, and redirections gracefully.
- **Input/Output Redirection**: Supports redirecting input and output using operators like `>`, `<`, `>>`.
- **Execution of Programs in PATH**: The shell searches for executables in directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.
